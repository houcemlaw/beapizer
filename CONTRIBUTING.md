# Contributing to BeAPIzer


## Reporting bugs

* Before opening a new issue, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/houcemlaw/beapizer/issues) to avoid duplication. If the issue does not yet exist, [create one](https://github.com/houcemlaw/beapizer/issues/new).
  * Please post any relevant code samples, preferably a standalone script that
  reproduces your issue. Do **not** describe your issue in prose. **Show your code.**
  * If the bug involves an error, please post the stack trace.
  * Please post the version of BeAPIzer that you're using.
  * Please write bug reports in JavaScript that runs in Node.js, **not** CoffeeScript, TypeScript, JSX, etc.

## Fixing bugs / Adding features

* Before starting to write code, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/houcemlaw/beapizer/issues). That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch. You can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/houcemlaw/beapizer/issues/new).
  * *The source of this project is written in JavaScript, not CoffeeScript or TypeScript. Please write your bug reports in JavaScript that can run in vanilla Node.js*.
* Fork the [repo](https://github.com/houcemlaw/beapizer) *or* for small documentation changes, navigate to the source on github and click the Edit button.
* Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project:
  * 2 space tabs
  * no trailing whitespace
  * inline documentation for new methods, class members, etc.
